# Friendly monsters

This is a friendly monsters project that was made as an introduction to functional components in React with the objective of sharpening my basics.

### Interesting topics:

- Functional components
- Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- List rendering (unique key constraints)
- Search input workarounds
- Modular components
- Styling with css

## APIs used

For generating a list of names and websites, the program uses **jsonplaceholder**, and for getting unique images, it uses **robohash**.

## App Usage

The search _input_ field can be used to filter the set of shown monsters, and the dropdown pick element in the upper right corner can be used to modify the photos from the specified **robohash** sets.

**Enjoy ! ðŸ™Œ**
